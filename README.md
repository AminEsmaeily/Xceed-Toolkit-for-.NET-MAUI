Xceed is excited to introduce its new Toolkit for MAUI! 

This toolkit is an open-source and free version that includes additional controls and features to supplement the existing "basic controls". Our aim is to bridge the gap and provide developers with the tools they need to create exceptional user experiences.

For those familiar with WPF, this toolkit will feel familiar, and we've made every effort to create a seamless transition for you. Our goal is to provide a comfortable and intuitive experience, making it easy to get started and get productive quickly.

Currently, the toolkit includes a range of controls, with more to come in the future. These controls include an improved Border, Button, RepeatButton, ToggleButton, ContentControl Card control which includes 48 accent colors for each control. We're committed to continually improving and updating the toolkit to meet the evolving needs of developers.

Thank you for considering Xceed's Toolkit for MAUI. We're excited to see what you create with it! Meanwhile, hereâ€™s more information on the controls we provide:
